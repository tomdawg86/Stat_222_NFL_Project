 \frametitle{\centerline{The Research Question}}
In football there are many decisions a team needs to make in order to win the game. In this project we focus on the decision that needs to be made on the 4th down of any given play. There are three decisions to be made on the fourth down. \\
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item 
Punt
\item
Kick a field goal
\item
Go for a first down
\end{enumerate}
In this project we try to determine which decision should be made under certain conditions. The following are the conditions which we take into account in determining the decision.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item
Offensive and defensive rank of the offensive team.
\item
Offensive and defensive rank of the defensive team.
\item
The number of yards to convert a first down.
\item
The field position started from.
\end{enumerate}
With this information from the data we were able to estimate the expected points scored for each of the of three decisions.\\
Finally, with this information a decision can be made.
